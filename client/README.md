# Project Title
FITrack

# Description
FITrack is an easy-to-use web app that enables users to log their daily exercise while keeping up with their fitness goals and progress. 

# Built With
- React
- PassportJS
- ExpressJS

# How it Works
When accessing the app, a user will have the option to sign up or log in to track his/her daily exercise. Once signed in, an exercise log displays that allows a user to select a specific day, and to choose from a list of exercises. The user can track additional stats and progress using the text field. After an exercise entry is added, the form is reset to give the user an opportunity to input additional exercises. Each entry added is then recorded in the database when the user selects "Save". A user can view all exercises logged by selecting the "View Exercise Logs" link.
