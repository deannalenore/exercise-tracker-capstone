# Project Title
Exercise Tracker

# Description
Exercise Tracker is an easy-to-use web app that enables user to log their daily exercise while keeping up with their fitness goals using a built-in journal. 

# Motivation
The inspiration behind Cabin Fever centered around the current global pandemic that is keeping people social distanced, causing cancelled events and postponed travel plans. Cabin Fever seeks to give users a fun, engaging way to see the world while in quarantine and to become inspired to make long-awaited travel plans when the world returns to some semblance of normalcy. 

# Built With
- React
- Redux

# How it Works
Cabin Fever is a single-player game that presents a series of cards with hidden images to be revealed during the game. The player will click on a single card to reveal an image, and then select a second card to determine if there is a match. If a match is made, the cards remain uncovered, and the player earns one point. If a match is not made, the cards will reset, and the player can continue uncovering cards until a match is made. At anytime, the player can restart the game, by clicking the "Reset" button.
